TODO:

0. Actually finish the NPM package and test in brand new next app with `npx create-next-app@latests` or a React with ?`npm create vite-app`?

1. Add option for header in the offcanvas menu:

    - Implement a prop or configuration option to allow users to provide a custom header for the offcanvas menu. This could include a title, logo, or any other content they want to display at the top of the menu.

2. Add option to customize the hamburger icon:

    - Create props or configuration options to allow users to customize the appearance of the hamburger icon, such as color, size, hover effects, etc. This gives users the flexibility to match the icon with their design theme.

3. Extract classnames for animations into a separate CSS file:

    - Move the CSS styles related to animations into a separate CSS file, making it easier for users to customize or override the animation styles without modifying the core code.

4. Implement pills for menu items:

    - Enhance the offcanvas menu to support pills for menu items. These pills can be used to highlight or categorize menu items. Consider the styling and placement of the pills to ensure they are visually appealing and distinguishable.

5. Make pills optional (allow disabling them if not needed):

    - Implement a prop or configuration option to allow users to enable or disable the display of pills for menu items. This gives users the flexibility to choose whether or not to use pills based on their specific requirements.

6. Allow creating new pills with custom colors and text:

    - Implement functionality to allow users to add new pills dynamically to the menu. Provide props or configuration options to allow users to specify custom colors and text for these additional pills. This allows for greater customization and flexibility.

7. Implement a way to add new menu items dynamically:

    - Create functionality to allow users to add new menu items to the offcanvas menu dynamically. This could be done through props, configuration options, or a separate function. Consider how the new menu items will be structured and rendered within the menu.

8. Check and ensure responsiveness of the offcanvas menu:
    - Test and optimize the offcanvas menu for different screen sizes and devices. Ensure that the menu is responsive and behaves correctly across various breakpoints. Address any layout or usability issues that may arise on different devices.

Feel free to modify or further expand each task based on your specific requirements and implementation details.
